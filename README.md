## About NeoGoat

NeoGoat is a curated evolution of classic Goat Format.

It maintains the strategic depth of the pre-Cybernetic Revolution era while introducing:
- A controlled rotating Extra Pool
- Bi-monthly banlists
- A modernized competitive environment
- Community-driven experimentation

NeoGoat is not a nostalgia clone.
It is a living sandbox format.
